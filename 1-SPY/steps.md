Step 1: Conceptualize the user experience (UX)
Instead of chapters, think of your story in terms of experiences.
Interactive Dossier: Structure your website like a digital spy dossier. The landing page could be a locked file that the reader has to "hack" into, introducing them to the story's main subject.
Timeline with Interactive Evidence: Create a timeline of events that the reader can scroll through. Each point on the timeline can be an interactive hotspot, revealing video footage, encrypted messages, or redacted documents.
Non-linear Exploration: Allow the reader to piece the story together themselves by navigating different locations or character files. A reader might choose to learn about the antagonist first, or follow the protagonist's movements across a globe.
Step 2: Plan your visual and multimedia assets
A compelling visual narrative uses more than just text.
Scrollytelling: As the reader scrolls down the page, visual elements can slide in, out, or change in a dynamic way. You can use this to reveal flashbacks or showcase a character's training montage.
Character Profiles: Create rich profiles for your main characters that include photos, voice recordings of interviews or intercepts, and notes on their relationships. Let the reader click to explore their files and see connections to other characters.
Sound Design: Use ambient soundscapes and music to create atmosphere. A tense scene could have a low, building hum that cuts to a sharp audio cue when the reader discovers a key piece of information.
Animated Scenes: For key action sequences, you can use short, animated scenes or graphic novel-style comics to make the moments more dramatic and immersive.
