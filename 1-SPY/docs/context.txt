Treat these 8 chapter like 8 movies/ films


It would be a non linear storytelling but first for our understanding I would be the setting the linear layout they are protagonists would be divided into four stages first is childhood then is teenage then his adulthood and then old age


Right now I'm just giving the random details and context so that afterward we could join the dots along though it would be able to set in a nonlinear environment


Our protagonist core essence would be A person with no hope or he doesn't hopes anything for


Our story would be setting in 4 countries for now India America Russia China
Update context about countries Add two more countries Iran/Iraq/Syria and london


Due to our protagonist works he would be known across the lands even though he would be having no iddentity/existence on the system As he would choosing After teenage to join raw


In teenage There would be some part of college romance having two characters introduced to the protagonist 1 male and 1 female after some time Then there would be war like scenario and India would be calling for young youth from males only support as our protagonist would be having a Training background he would be called for and along with his male friend from the college for participating in war Even in the short time our protagonist would be building a great bond Of friendship / brotherhood with the male friend as both male and female character from college are his core circle So as the war happens in the war conclusion the male friend dies/ sacrifice and are protagonist gets Nailed with vengeance that he decides to destroy this thing till the roots that became the reason or the cause of the war. And at that time only the Raw's Recruitment for special program is going on So whoever from the youth fought for the war are given a chance to have this opportunity without outspreading their news to their families and friends so as our protagonist Is consumed by vengeance he doesn't care about female friend in the college and chooses to opt for this raw program so as the conditions of this program whoever would be participating would be erased from the system and would have only a paper record that would be highly secured and only known by the three higher officials no one other else for maintaining the secrecy and that secrecy would be passed away as three officials would keep this program under them. this would be one chapter


For protagonist this would be not the first time he would be going to a war - Before admitting to the college he has been part of two to three training wars between countries From this two to three year experience once our protagonist Helped and created impression on one American marshall (The highest post officer on the battleship). This character would become helpful in further future


This American character is inspired from Sylvester Stallone Who would help us in America to return their favor even though he would be stopped by American president via call But then also he chooses the protagonist because he helped him in time when no one could even know the president So as a favor returning gesture he would be also doing the same caring about no one and till the time this character would be helping the protagonist He would be at major post in the US government so basically no one could threaten him at that position because he has power to overthrow the government but he would not


Basically are protagonists would going America after Signaling rogue intentions to the raw agency made only few people would be knowing the real intention and purpose in the raw. He would be going to America and would get himself present as he would have become rogue so now no nation wants join his name with them so it's like now our protagonist has become a trading material for the countries On whom they can cash out on or similarly policies that strong diplomatic ties from the rogue protagonist exchange. As American president would be knowing about this and that they have the trace of him  and have catched him and put him into a secure prison. So the American president get some thoughts like now he would be negotiate some favourable deals with India or maybe who gives him the best deal in other countries for this guy (Again cementing he is known across the lands). But the real intention of the protagonist should be he willingly wants that he get captured and also planned out in advance in which prison he wants to be sent as he wants to interrogate a person who is in that prison But our protagonist would also be not knowing one thing that there would be Indian Mafia guy who has been extradited in America and imprisoned their. The India Mafia guy is big brother of gangster who rules Mumbai and have collections all over India and have even international influence but this would coming in the climax Our protagonist doesn't know about this guy but this guy gets the information about in the American jail about our protagonist so you can think so how this mafia guy would be strong that even the top secret information is a call away for him. For this Indian mafia guy he would be having a 2G old nokia phone. Only having five to 10 numbers but these are enough for him to have control and contact with his small brother and again in American prison


It's not like the Indian mafia guy knows when the protagonist is send in Prison initially but as we know there is also inner system in the presence temple the guy who holds the power on others would run the prison and maybe he would be not known by many people in the prison but then also he has the physical strength to make some of them obey and kind of created a group sort of thing so there would be a prison ritual like every weekend There is a minor riot for the testing of new prisoners who is weak who is strong and sort of entertainment for the policeman staff also. This is kind of organized but also chaotically random The powerful ones notice everything with a careful observation and the weaker ones try to prove that they are this strong than each other Who lives who lives who dies who dies but the one person are Indian mafia guy has eye on is this new one who entered in the prison are protagonist because he doesn't have a normal routine of person who has been imprisoned and behave so This makes him suspicious about our protagonist and he tries to get know how about him. And after getting the information that he's someone who get our work done so then our Indian Mafia guys in another riot seeks to try brute strength between him and protagonist even though the Indian mafia guy has upper hand in strength as our protagonist is trained he makes sure that the Mafia guy realizes that if you can't touch some things then don't Or a simple don't judge a book by its cover. Why mafia guy sees our protagonist as gain because In the past he was betrayed by the some corrupted Indian politicians and as he was running the business internationally the The CIA and Interpol wanted him to be captured so the corrupted politicians sold the Mafia guy to the CIA And created a situation when he got extradited to America and was imprisoned His small brother tried lobby politician Use international influence but no one was putting their heads into this so now our protagonist would be the key as they think so OK like we have tried other things too but let's try this one too


The thing would be like when our protagonist is in the jail he gets the piece of information and after knowing the intentions of mafia guy. our protagonist promise the guy that he has some prior matter to solve but his gains in this ??. the mafia guy tells once let me out of here. there would be nothing that would stop in india or even around world. as our protagonist has no plan to else-were after state of information extracted he decided to use his american guy to make the arrangement that it doesnt look suspicious on mafia guy part. 


There would be a legal bailout It would be a just illusion to get out mafia boss and the protagonist From the prison And they would automatically fend off as they would land in India. Keynote the bail costed 80 lacs INR for both as legal doc(80 number - just a suspense focus piece). So as the Mafia guy is back in India he ensures that he saves specific contact number that is only available to the protagonist as these numbers would be fully secure no one can hack As because of creating communication back in the prison his brother casually thought out of launching satellite only to communicate with his big brother in the American prison So during that advantage they have this kind of facility. Show now raw gets the hint the rogue protagonist is back in India from the airport CCTV footage They tries to capture him but before they could are a protagonist is already facilitated a flight by the mafia guy two Russia or China right now not know where to land but for context this would be the plot scene


Here we will leave a cliffhanger as we would not answer where the protagonist went after this flight. Now we will start developing the London part as after destroying the roots in Iraq / Iran / Syria now our protagonist has laid low from the global Grid. He Remember that even vengeance could not serve him peace He still feels empty and remembers that there was a female friend It's not like he had forgotten about her its just as he was joining the RAW program as the removal of his identity he was declared as martyred in the war for the rest of the world and this news was propagated to her friend And she thought that the protagonist is dead with his another friend So he was for some time numb about this But then as life goes on he moved on and studied the behavior sciences and due to her exceptional skills she also joined Govt position and later as the recognition of her skills he was shifted to can say coincidence. So now she was working everywhere as was needed globally for India. Tracking and hunting investigating personals finding patterns to specific persons and kind of things where her Expertise was. 


As the Roots are destroyed that caused the war in which protagonist's male friend Sacrificed. This destabilizes a corruption deal which Eventually make responsible one of the Indian officer who was the originally part of three person committee who would be knowing about the RAW program. But the Indian officer can't Able to connect the DOTs and doesn't know because of whom the problem caused that deal was destabilized. So he Starts an investigation and as a result of that investigation he gets to know that there was a person involved but now the problem is they don't know any weakness They can capture him off or any trace where they can find him along. So they doesn't mig official information out but just given high level explanation bid to the people whom they employ to capture The protagonist and for this consignment only the female friend has posted to London but for now nobody knows Not even the Indian officer or female friend or protagonist Then what is this happening afterwards as Indian officer would also be running a routine background check on the employees he would be coming across a detail that would cite him common that the female friend is also studied from the same college a year where the protagonist had studied along show then he tries to lure the female friend to find the protagonist without revealing that Whom she's finding but as she is true to her work she tries everything she gets suspicious about this get this behavior pattern are matching with someone but she doesn't knows with whom As for her logically human behavior patent could match with dead person but if the person is dead how could be there another person she have the probability that the protagonist is alive but she what if. The level of information that give the hold of situation would flow like this First Indian officer would understand everything then female friend would be getting just about this but can't figure out the whole thing out due to contradiction And then at last the protagonist would get idea of what's going around


Now as the Indian officer would be knowing that there would be no weakness of the protagonist but due to this female may be having some connection to him Let's try to guide the investigation through her. So Now to test if the female has any connections to the protagonist or not the Indian officer plans and yacht collapse accident on which are yard hosting a party Knowingly headed towards down shaft of the river That would potentially make yacht topple But as one else is enjoying the party no one notices this until the situation comes around SO as our protagonist lives in shadow and even though he observes from afar. As the day on which this situation is going to happen our protagonist gets information from a helper working around in the organization As to ensure if yaxht doesn,t topples, there should be a Goon's ambush. Like Indian officer had planned it like plan AB situation if plan A fails plan B ensures the work so to outsmart the Indian officer. what the protagonist does is he kind of mixes into the goons ambush As goons were already in the yacht's basement He cleverly executes the yacht captain who is working with Indian officer then as other goons aware about this They try to capture everyone including the female friend So here are protagonists cleverly executes them also and throw them into river and eventually himself also jumps into the river so the female friend couldn't notice that he was there to save her but she made eye contact with the protagonist and she didn't know but she kind of felt she met him but again as she knows he's dead so she assumed that he's just hallucinating this. By this way Indian officer has layered the female friend with fear Building a strong trust in her mind And also got a gist that even though he tried kind of ham the female friend then also anyhow the plan Has failed This would be kind of a mistake on the protagonist part as he has given a hint to Indian officer But this would be the dynamics of the situation


Now as the tension rises the Indian officer try to task female friend with the redacted documents even though identity still concealed but it is coming much closer to the persona and now the suspicion of would be coming closer to reality How we would say as our protagonist wait he gets to know that as he knows the nature of Indian officer he is impatient for results. So what the protagonist does is he plans an Total breakout in the agency with full blowout weapons in London even though it is highly secured building he just the way he's out through With one purpose only to take back the female friend with him he his adversaries in London and then with Starting silent moves in upper layer moving towards chaotic approach in the inner layers of the building at the end Protagonist reaches to the female friend but now the situation here would be like that as female friend so protagonist standing alive she thinks in disbelief that this person might be a duplicate so she takes out her gun and points toward the protagonist but as protagonist had faith in her protagonist slowly move towards her putting her gunpoint straight towards the heart and still moving forward pushing the female friend backwards still pointing towards protagonist Till there is to a wall end behind the female friend. But female friend doesn't know that someone from the CCTV camera is watching all this none other than Indian officer. But our protagonist Knows this very well and to make convince that female doesn't I have a link protagonist put he's gone on the forehead of the Female friend. So as Indian officer is watching from the CCTV camera he thinks maybe he would thinking too much about it and shut the footage down as Indian officer has the habit of AB approach his plan he was the high security building and his plan B is the remote detonation of the building And about this protagonist is already knowing as he very well knows the Indian officer in and out so he cuts the connection of the CCTV camera and the remote detonation and after leaving the building with the female friend he resumed the connection and detonated the building seeming as the protagonist and female friend are both dead in building blast
