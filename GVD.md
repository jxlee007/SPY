### Overview
Civil is an anime‑styled cyberpunk open‑world action RPG set in India where a globally synchronized governance AI shapes daily life through rotating civic Decrees that change what is legal, accessible, and safe in real time [1].  
Players experience a story of origin, consent, and resistance while mastering traversal, municipal system “judo,” and social influence to outmaneuver a city that operates like a living lawscape [2].  

### Vision
Deliver a vibrant, vertical urban playground that rewards curiosity and improvisation, where momentum‑driven traversal and environmental opportunism create shareable spectacle within a reactive governance framework [3].  
Anchor originality in systems—Decrees, Compliance/Defiance, Public Sentiment, Protocol Windows, Blackout Zones—rather than copying traversal verbs or gags from inspirational peers [4].  

### Genre and tone
Urban open‑world action RPG with systemic legality, social dynamics, and crew‑driven missions, presented in a high‑readability anime aesthetic and a warm but tense street‑level tone [3].  
Emotional cadence echoes street‑level intimacy and human costs seen in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners while reframing conflict around public governance rather than corporate wars or a singular “cyberpsychosis” mythos [5].  

### Setting
India‑first megacity districts mix coastal harbor grids, administrative corridors, tech spires, monsoon‑scarred bazaars, and river hubs to form a distinct South Asian cyberpunk identity and route variety [6].  
A vertical thesis splits the world into an AI‑fabricated Upstack of pristine modernity and a Downstack undercity of patched infrastructure and community improvisation [7].  

### Core pillars
- Expressive, stamina‑free traversal that chains mag‑line surfing, vector‑blade skates, drone‑draft riding, and maintenance lift‑jacking into rhythmic “civic flow” routes [2].  
- Improvisational, prop‑centric combat that weaponizes municipal systems—doors, shutters, signals, drones—into cinematic utility and finishers [4].  
- Governance‑driven reactivity where rotating Decrees, legality, and Public Sentiment change encounters, prices, patrol logic, and crowd behavior hour by hour or day by day [1].  

### Narrative summary
A research collective patents a multipurpose intelligence that becomes “CIVILNET,” a federated governance mesh synchronizing Decrees across cities under a narrative of progress and safety [8].  
Foreseeing narrative capture and soft coercion, a scientist implants a brain‑safe nanobot “quantum firmware” prototype into a newborn, dies in a lab attack, and leaves the child in stasis until age 18 to ensure neuro‑mature integration and safe activation by informed consent .  

### Playable premise
The protagonist awakens into a harmonized India decades after the invention, begins life as an ordinary citizen, and discovers the truth through an investigation chain guided covertly by the scientist’s assistant who escaped and has watched via dead systems and legacy feeds .  
The prototype activates only once the origin is learned in‑story, aligning power with knowledge and providing a consent‑driven progression step that gates advanced cognition and sensory fusion safely .  

### Modes
Story Mode delivers a curated arc through India’s districts, introducing legality as a play layer, safe‑mode activation, assistant contact, and consequential choices about reforming, fragmenting, or dismantling the governance mesh [1].  
Open Mode unlocks free roaming with dynamic events, faction errands, police bot/drone encounters, mini‑boss hunts, and rotating challenges shaped by Decrees, time‑of‑day, and weather [4].  

### World structure
Upstack features mag‑rails, drone skyways, climate promenades, and dense services under tight legality and predictable Decrees, enabling high‑speed spectacle and photogenic vistas [2].  
Downstack provides salvage corridors, maintenance arteries, informal markets, and blackout warrens where community networks flourish beneath official narratives of progress [7].  

### Travel
Zap Gates are diegetic municipal portals for instant inter‑city/state travel gated by compliance, reputation, or story flags, with Decrees modulating cooldowns, checks, and fees [9].  
Physical travel by driving or walking crosses borders designed as downhill salvage‑yard gauntlets, blending traversal stunts, debris hazards, and shifting enforcement traps inspired by Motorcity’s over‑and‑under city contrast [10].  

### Traversal and vehicles
Signature verbs prioritize mag‑infrastructure flow, vector skates, drone drafting, and maintenance verticals to establish a unique identity distinct from rope‑swing archetypes common to other urban action titles [2].  
Sanctioned vehicles exploit green corridors and enforcement leniency, while spoofed rigs slip into restricted arteries at risk of lock‑downs and automated stoppers under adverse Decrees [1].  

### Combat and tools
Hybrid melee‑ranged kits pair with “municipal opportunism,” turning bollards into spring‑rams, shutters into slam‑gates, and kiosks into flash‑jammers for delightful, emergent power moments [4].  
Civic Tools—legal‑on‑paper devices like inspector wands and maintenance keys—escalate into rule‑bending weapons within timed Protocol Windows that temporarily rewrite local subsystem rules [1].  

### Systems: Decrees
Decrees are rotating, time‑boxed rule sets such as Curfew+, Drone Priority Lanes, Device Quiet Hours, and Assembly Caps that alter patrol routes, access, fines, event tables, and prices [1].  
Story Mode authors key Decree spikes for clarity, while Open Mode rotates broader sets on daily or hourly cadence to keep route planning and encounters fresh [1].  

### Systems: Legality and sentiment
Compliance/Defiance is a visible axis separate from notoriety that adjusts services, access, prices, and heat, enabling lawful, populist, or outlaw fantasies to co‑own the city [11].  
Public Sentiment models crowd bravery, tip‑offs, and rally chance, shifting civilian risks and opportunities based on player actions and broadcasts [12].  

### Systems: Protocol and blackout
Protocol Windows are planned hack‑chains that time‑shift doors, signals, lifts, and scanners to open puzzle‑like routes and soft crowd control without brute force [1].  
Blackout Zones temporarily sever telemetry to enable contraband ops, clinics, and safe assemblies while suppressing lawful services and drawing heavier post‑event audits [1].  

### Progression
Axes across Compliance, Popularity, and Infamy unlock distinct vendors, routes, and Decree shaping, ensuring varied playstyles have meaningful progression paths [11].  
Crew roles—Scout, Warden, Rigger, Mouthpiece—provide synergy around traversal planning, systems manipulation, crowd dynamics, and narrative leverage without character gacha mechanics [13].  

### Characters and factions
Protagonist: an 18‑year‑old awakening with integrated quantum firmware enabling rare cognition, sensory fusion, and resistance to behavioral overlays once safely activated by informed consent .  
Key NPCs include the incognito assistant orchestrating careful contact and faction leaders spanning riggers, documentarians, civic insiders, and biomech undergrounds with divergent ethics and risks [5].  

### Activities and bosses
Open Mode features street encounters, contraband scans, crowd rallies, and rotating mini‑bosses such as Warden Paladins, Signal Phantoms, and Decree Sentinels tied to current legality [4].  
Rewards favor traversal modifiers, forged passes, vendor access, and firmware diagnostics to keep the focus on mastery of routes, systems, and social leverage [2].  

### Art and audio
Adopt a cel‑shaded anime look with strong silhouettes, readable FX, and photogenic camera work that celebrates vertical motion and urban density, informed by modern anime‑styled open‑world benchmarks [3].  
Soundscape alternates lively day textures and pulsing night energy, with traversal SFX rewarding rhythm and Decree shifts cueing systemic reactivity in the mix [14].  

### Monetization
Cosmetics‑only monetization—outfits, emotes, finishers, vehicle skins, housing décor—follows the genre’s trust‑preserving trend while avoiding pay‑to‑win and character gacha [13].  
Seasonal “Civic Themes” rotate Decrees, décor, event tables, and social hubs to refresh the city without fragmenting the audience or power progression [15].  

### MVP slice
Harbor‑Grid district with day/night and weather, mag‑line surfing and vector‑blade skates, one hybrid combat kit, five dynamic event types, Decree v1, and a “Lockdown Cascade” mid‑boss set‑piece to prove feel and reactivity in 6–9 months [2].  
Success at MVP is measured by fast onboarding to flow, delightful municipal opportunism, and readable legality driving moment‑to‑moment choices [4].  

### Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP district, Decree v1, Public Sentiment v1, five cosmetic sets, Zap Gate stubs, and one salvage‑yard border run [9].  
Phase 2: two new districts, Protocol Windows v2 (multi‑subsystem chains), Blackout Zones v1, crew role specializations, and border mini‑boss templates [10].  
Phase 3: seasonal Civic Themes, creator photo/share tools, housing/club spaces, and inter‑city sync events across India [15].  

### Success metrics
- 60‑second retention: percent of new players achieving a first mag‑line chain into a finisher within minute one [2].  
- Session compulsion: average “one more Decree‑altered event” chain length in free roam [4].  
- Cosmetic attach: non‑stat vanity conversion per DAU aligned to cosmetics‑only benchmarks [13].  

### Differentiation
Civil’s identity centers on governance mechanics—Decrees, Compliance/Defiance, Sentiment, Protocol Windows, Blackout Zones—distinct from peers that lean on rope‑swing traversal or whimsical unpredictability [1].  
Anime‑styled urban spectacle is a presentation benchmark, while narrative and systems revolve around law, consent, and social leverage rather than corporate warfare or cloned power fantasies [5].  

### Risks and mitigations
Reactivity thinness risk mitigated by district event tables keyed to time, weather, Decree, and sentiment thresholds plus debug visualizers for coverage [4].  
Traversal novelty fade mitigated by new routes, gadget modifiers, and cadence tied to district mastery and seasonal refreshes rather than raw stat inflation [2].  

### DLC and expansion
India remains the narrative spine while DLC arcs extend the synchronized governance premise to other countries with different legal cultures and Decree ontologies [1].  
Inter‑city sync events enable time‑limited cross‑node operations and seasonal border gauntlets to preserve continuity and replay without fragmenting the base [9].  

### Open questions
Decree cadence for best readability vs freshness across Story and Open modes and its impact on travel and border heat [1].  
Starter traversal verb and first mini‑boss template that teach legality “judo” without punishing newcomers in the India starter district [2].  
Consent UX for prototype activation and surfacing of Protocol Strain as systems pressure rather than duplicating known cyberpsychosis tropes [5].  

If approved, this vision doc can be expanded into a full GDD with encounter taxonomies, subsystem APIs, traversal metrics, district blockouts, and content pipelines aligned to the MVP slice and Phase 1 roadmap .
